With the Payment Policy associated with a listing, the immediate payment requirement must be enabled.</li><li>The postal/zip code (<strong>PostalCode</strong> field in Trading's <strong>ItemType</strong>) or city (<strong>Location</strong> field in Trading's <strong>ItemType</strong>) must be set in the listing; the country is also needed, but this value is required in Trading API, so it will always be set for every listing</li></ul><br><h3>Unsupported Listing Features</h3><br>The following features are not yet available to be set or modified through the Inventory API, but they will remain on the active eBay listing, even after a successful migration to the Inventory model.
